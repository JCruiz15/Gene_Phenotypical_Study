   abstract = {Several agents are approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including the novel monoclonal antibody belimumab, a B lymphocyte stimulator-specific inhibitor. However, no drugs have been licensed specifically for the treatment of skin manifestations of the disease. Therefore, therapeutic agents are applied off-label for patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), mainly based on the experience of experts. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for all different subtypes of the disease, but they are of limited value because of their well-known side effects, such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia. A safe and effective alternative topical treatment for CLE are the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. Irrespective of the subtype of the disease, antimalarials, such as hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, are the first-line systemic treatment for disfiguring and widespread skin manifestations. Systemic steroids can be used additionally in patients with highly acute and severe skin lesions but should be time limited due to the common side effects, such as osteoporosis. In contrast to immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine, methotrexate has received more attention in the therapeutic management of skin manifestations of the disease. Further second-line treatment includes retinoids, dapsone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Other agents, such as rituximab and ustekinumab, have been used in single cases of therapy-refractory CLE and need to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.},

   abstract = {CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS The spectrum of COL4A1-related disorders includes: small-vessel brain disease of varying severity including porencephaly, variably associated with eye defects (retinal arterial tortuosity, Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, cataract) and systemic findings (kidney involvement, muscle cramps, cerebral aneurysms, Raynaud phenomenon, cardiac arrhythmia, and hemolytic anemia). On imaging studies, small-vessel brain disease is manifest as diffuse periventricular leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, microhemorrhage, dilated perivascular spaces, and deep intracerebral hemorrhages. Clinically, small-vessel brain disease manifests as infantile hemiparesis, seizures, single or recurrent hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and isolated migraine with aura. Porencephaly (fluid-filled cavities in the brain detected by CT or MRI) is typically manifest as infantile hemiparesis, seizures, and intellectual disability; however, on occasion it can be an incidental finding. HANAC (hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps) syndrome usually associates asymptomatic small-vessel brain disease, cerebral large vessel involvement (i.e., aneurysms), and systemic findings involving the kidney, muscle, and small vessels of the eye. Two additional phenotypes include isolated retinal artery tortuosity and nonsyndromic autosomal dominant congenital cataract. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing of COL4A1. MANAGEMENT Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care tailored to the individual’s specific medical needs and including practical help and emotional support for affected individuals and their families. Hypertension should be treated to reduce the overall risk of stroke. Prevention of primary and secondary complications: Avoiding head trauma and anticoagulant exposure may decrease the risk for intracerebral hemorrhage. Surveillance: Depends on the severity and type of symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking and hypertension because these factors increase the risk for stroke; sustained head pressure or physical activities that may cause head trauma; anticoagulant use. GENETIC COUNSELING COL4A1-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with a COL4A1-related disorder have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is estimated to be at least 27%. Each child of an individual with a COL4A1-related disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal diagnosis is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.},

@article{RaynaudClass,
   abstract = {Abstract: Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) is used to describe a symptom complex caused by digital vascular compromise. RP is a clinical diagnosis. The typically episodic nature of RP has resulted in a reliance upon patient self-report for diagnosis. The term ‘primary RP’ is generally applied when no underlying pathology can be demonstrated. Whilst ‘primary RP’ is currently considered a distinct disorder, there is evidence that the term may comprise several entities that include a functional vasospastic disorder, a physiologically appropriate thermoregulatory response, subclinical atherosclerosis and ‘cold intolerance’. Optimal management may differ depending on cause. The term ‘secondary RP’ encompasses a broad range of rheumatological, haematological, endocrinological and vascular pathology. RP can range from relatively benign but intrusive vasospasm, to the progressive obliterative microangiopathy of systemic sclerosis (SSc), in which severe digital ischaemia can threaten tissue viability. SSc has formed the focus of much of the research into RP but, consistent with most medical symptom complexes, the aetiopathogenesis of RP varies greatly dependent on cause. Vasospasm within the digital macro- and microvasculature occurs in SSc, but digital ischaemia is further compounded by a progressive obliterative microangiopathy. Recent work exploring the patient experience of SSc-RP is challenging the ‘episodic’ paradigm of ‘Raynaud’s’, with important implications for clinical trials utilising diary-based patient-reported outcome instruments for assessing Raynaud’s symptoms. This review shall examine the causes, pathogenesis, clinical features, classification and management of RP. A practical approach to the evaluation and management of RP is outlined, highlighting important knowledge gaps and unmet research needs where applicable.},

@article{RaynaudConcepts,
   abstract = {Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a transient, acral, vasospastic phenomenon that manifests with characteristic color changes. This vasospasm, classically triggered by cold temperatures, may also be driven by shifts in temperature, climate, or emotional state. Primary RP (PRP) is a common condition without severe sequelae. Secondary RP (SRP), which may be driven by vascular, autoimmune, hematologic, or endocrine etiologies, can result in digital ulceration, irreversible ischemia and necrosis, and secondary infection. This review delineates the clinical manifestations of both primary and secondary RP, as well as the current understanding of RP epidemiology and pathogenesis. Proper examination, including nailfold capillary microscopy, and laboratory workup for secondary causes of RP are also discussed. The traditional armamentarium of therapies used for RP, as well as newer medical and surgical options, is also summarized with particular regard to the clinical evidence for their efficacy.},
